	<history>
	Memento Dawn was started in 2018 by Dat Do (DD), a game enthusiast and developer. The game is inspired by puzzle games like Monument Valley, Lara Croft Go, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, which were famous and popular then. Unfortunately, many troubles slowed the development, and the project had to be pending in 2021. In 2023, DD tried to restart his game again, so he came up with his friends to get full-time focus on completing Memento Dawn as a new indie game team. There were still many challenges and problems, but thanks to family and friends' support. The game has been developing very well, and we plan to release it in 2025.
