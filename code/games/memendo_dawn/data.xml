	<history>
	Memento Dawn was started by Dat Do (DD) in 2017, a game developer and puzzle game lover. The game's inspired by Monument Valley and Lara Croft Go, which were famous and popular then. Unfortunately, making games isn't easy, and development has many challenges. It looks like the game has never been finished. In 2023, after leaving the company, DD tried to finish his game again, so he came up with his friends to get full-time focus on completing Memento Dawn. It still pains a lot as a new indie game team, but thanks for supporting from many friends. The game is developing very well; this time, we can finish and release it in 2024.
