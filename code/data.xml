			<header>The debut game</header>
			<text>DepaGames is a tiny game team founded by Dat Do (DD) and his friends. In 2018, after finishing a game project at the company, DD tried to make a new game to satisfy his gaming enthusiasm in his free time. Unfortunately, making games isn't easy and costs a lot. After year to year, many things happened, and the game looks like it has never been finished. In 2023, after leaving the company, DD tried to finish his game again, so he came up with his friends to found DepaGames, which focuses on the first game, Memento Dawn. It still pains a lot, but thanks to family and friends' support. The game has been developing very well, and we plan to release it in 2025.</text>
